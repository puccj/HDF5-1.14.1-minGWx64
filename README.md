# HDF5-1.14.1-minGWx64
A prebuilt version of HDF5 made for MinGW compiler (x64).


In the HDF5 site the prebuilt version for Windows is only made for Visual Studio compiler, so I needed to build the source myself with CMake to make it work for my case (MinGW x64).
I upload the files here in order to save me (and anyone with the same compiler) time in the future.
